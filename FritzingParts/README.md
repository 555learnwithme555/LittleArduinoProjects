# Fritzing Parts

This is just a place where I'm recording custom Fritzing parts that I'm using for various schematics.

## New Parts

These are new parts I've created because I wasn't able to find an existing alternative:

* [74LS75 Quad Latch](./74LS75)
* [LM324 Quad OpAmp](./LM324)
* Stepper Motor 28BYJ-48 - available in the [X113647Stepper](https://github.com/tardate/X113647Stepper) repo
* Stepper Board X113647 - available in the [X113647Stepper](https://github.com/tardate/X113647Stepper) repo


## Locally Cached Parts

If the part source is not in a reliable repository (e.g. GitHub), I may copy the part here with a note on it's providence.

* [CD4017 (local copy)](./cached/CD4017.fzpz) - [original source](https://code.google.com/p/fritzing/issues/detail?id=875#c526)
