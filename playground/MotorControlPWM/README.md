# MotorControlPWM

Tests PWM speed control of a DC motor.

## Notes

Demonstrates using a PWM signal to control the current driving a DC motor, hence it's speed.

The small PWM signal is amplied with an NPN transistor.
An S9013 transistor is used in this case, primarily because:

* it has relative high hfe(Î²); for class H it typically ranges 144-202
* supports a decent continuous collector current (Ic) of 500mA (the motor I'm using is rated at 150mA)

A [fly-back diode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyback_diode) is placed across
the motor to drain any voltage spike as the motor load is switched.
