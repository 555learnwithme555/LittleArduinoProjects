# ATtinySleep

Test sleep mode with an ATtiny85 processor on a breadboard.

Here's a quick video of the circuit in action:

## Notes

This is a little test of sleep mode with an ATtiny85 microcontroller (8-pin DIP).

I'm using an Arduino Uno as an in-system programmer, using teh technique described in the [ATtinyWithArduinoISP](../ATtinyWithArduinoISP) project.

Once the ATtiny is programmed, the Arduino Uno ISP is detached, and it will run independently.
The ATtiny85 requires 1.8-5.5V to operate. I successfully tested with 3.3V and 5V supplies.

A push-button is attached to normally pull D2 high (pin 7 of the chip)
and a hardware interrupt service routine activates on LOW signal.
The interrupt acts as a "wake-up" call to the CPU.

The standard `loop` simply runs an LED sequence (for demo purposes) and then sends the processor to sleep.

The AVR library `set_sleep_mode` function and `sleep_mode` macro are use to put the processor to sleep.

Using `SLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN` .. apparently the most power-efficient, I measure power consumption falling to about 238ÂµA at 3.3V
when asleep. Not bad, but definitly not as low as you'd like for long periods of inactivity.
