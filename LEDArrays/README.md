# Addressable LED Arrays

I bought some [WS2811-based LED Strips](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/IP68-12mm-WS2811-as-WS2801-led-pixel-module-IP68-waterproof-DC5V-full-color-RGB-50pcs-a/1932649085.html) with a specific project in mind. But first, need to get them working...

* [Intro and Setup](./LEDArrays)
* [RGBCalibrate](./RGBCalibrate) - quick test to make sure LEDs are correctly addressable and their color can be set correctly
* [StripTease](./StripTease) - demo a range of effects on the LED strip
