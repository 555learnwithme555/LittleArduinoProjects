# Little Arduino Projects

Just my collection of electronics projects, many involving an Arduino in one way or another.
Some are extremely trivial, their inclusion here perhaps more a measure of my OCD than anything else.
Many are variations of things found wild on the net, or inspired by ideas from the following sources:

* [Arduino Cookbook (O'Reilly)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449313876/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1449313876&linkCode=as2&tag=itsaprli-20&linkId=5F6YF3D5RCEZYXUU)
* [Arduino StackExchange](http://arduino.stackexchange.com/)
* [Arduino Playground](http://playground.arduino.cc/)

Feel free to borrow liberally, and if you spot any issues do let me know. See the individual projects for credits where due.


## Highlights
Projects that have been taken all the way to a full build i.e. the ones that didn't get ripped apart for spares as soon as they were done!

* [Breadboard 5V Regulator](./Electronics101/PowerBreadboard5V) - custom regulated 5V power supply module for standard breadboard
* [FretBoard](./FretBoard) - a multi-project build status indicator, that pulls software build status from the net and animates the status of up to 24 projects with an LED array. Look at the picks to discover why it is called "The FretBoard"
* [Girabot](./Girabot) - EE40LX Electronic Interfaces robot project
* [MeLEDy](./Electronics101/MeLEDy) - simple volume level indicator


## Other Bits

* [Custom Fritzing Parts](./FritzingParts) - Most projects have a circuit schematic drawn with the wonderful [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) application. But often I needed a non-standard part for the diagram. Here they are.
* [PlotNValues](./processing/PlotNValues) - a [Processing](https://www.processing.org/download/) script that reads 1..n values from the serial port and plots on stacked charts. I've often used this as a super-low-rent stand-in for an oscilliscope.

# Getting Up and Running

Some projects require additional libraries including FastLED, FlexiTimer2, RadioHead.
A set of such libraries are included as submodules of this repository,
see the [libraries/](./libraries) page for more information on the included libraries and submodule management.

Libraries can be retrieved with git, or you can just install them separately as you would any other library.

If you clone this repo, also update the submodules to have them available for compilation/installation:

    $ git submodule update --init

To pull submodule updates later on:

    $ git submodule foreach git pull
