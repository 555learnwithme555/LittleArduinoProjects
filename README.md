# Little Arduino Projects

Just my collection of electronics projects, many involving an Arduino in one way or another.
Some are full builds like
[The FretBoard](./FretBoard) (a multi-project build status indicator),
while most are quite trivial breadboard kata, intended to test or explore a single idea.

Many are variations of things found wild on the net, or inspired by ideas from the sources such as:

* [Arduino Cookbook (O'Reilly)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449313876/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1449313876&linkCode=as2&tag=itsaprli-20&linkId=5F6YF3D5RCEZYXUU)
* [Arduino StackExchange](http://arduino.stackexchange.com/)
* [Arduino Playground](http://playground.arduino.cc/)

Feel free to borrow liberally, and if you spot any issues do let me know. See the individual projects for credits where due.

### Other Bits

* [Custom Fritzing Parts](./FritzingParts) - Most projects have a circuit schematic drawn with the wonderful [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) application. But often I needed a non-standard part for the diagram. Here they are.
* [PlotNValues](./processing/PlotNValues) - a [Processing](https://www.processing.org/download/) script that reads 1..n values from the serial port and plots on stacked charts. I've often used this as a super-low-rent stand-in for an oscilliscope.

## 93 Projects...
Latest addition - [BJTCurrentSink](./Electronics101/BJTCurrentSink) - test a BJT constant current sink circuit.

# Getting Up and Running

Some projects require additional libraries including FastLED, FlexiTimer2, RadioHead.
A set of such libraries are included as submodules of this repository,
see the [libraries/](./libraries) page for more information on the included libraries and submodule management.

Libraries can be retrieved with git, or you can just install them separately as you would any other library.

If you clone this repo, also update the submodules to have them available for compilation/installation:

    $ git submodule update --init

To pull submodule updates later on:

    $ git submodule foreach git pull
