## Notes

Just a simple little project to clean up my desk a little, where I oftern have various power connectors laying around.
This is a little adapter that can plug into the power rails of a breadboard, and provides:

* LED power indicator
* pins to plug into a breadboard power rail
* [5.5x2.1mm centre-positive barrel jack](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10PCS-5-5x2-1mm-Electrical-Socket-Outlet-DC-005-DC-Outlet-5000-Times-Black/32265586514.html)
* [2-pin terminal block](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-Shipping-20pcs-2-Pin-Screw-Terminal-Block-Connector-5mm-Pitch-B/663929906.html)
* [XH2.54-2P connector](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/5OPCS-XH2-54-2P-2-54mm-2A-Pitch-White-Tower-Connector-Straight-Needle-Seat-XH2-54/1246743_32787163509.html)

While I'm normally powering this from the barrel jack, it can actually be used to route power in from any of the connectors and out the others.

The connectors and LED, with current limiting resistor good for [conservatively up to 20V](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2.2k%CE%A9*10mA+%2B+2.0V),
are mounted on a small piece of protoboard, roughly laid out like this:
