# nRF24Breakout

A simple PCB breadboard adapter for 8-pin nRF24 modules

## Notes

This is my version of project 1 from the
[KiCad like a Pro](http://txplore.tv/courses/kicad-pro)
course from Tech Explorations.

It's about as simple as it gets - my main objective here is to try out the process
of sending PCB design to a small-quantity production fab.
I got interested in doing this after [seeing this hangout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XssjD97-xGM) with the
founder of OSH Park.

The PCB design was done with [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/).

I've sent these off for production, will update and share the OSH Park project when they're back and tested.

## Construction

See the [KiCad project](./kicad_project/nrf24_breakout.pro) for all the details. Here's the result:
