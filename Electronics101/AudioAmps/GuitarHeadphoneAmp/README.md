# GuitarHeadphoneAmp

An LM386 fixed-gain guitar headphone amp.

## Notes

Yet another LM386-based audio amplifier
similar to the [LittleGem/A386/Smokey](../LittleGem) series,
this time adapted as a guitar headphone amp.

The main differences in this case:
* gain is limited to 50x with pin 1 tied to 8 through R3 + C3.
* R1 at input is appropriate match for guitar input impedence

How it performs:
* the lack of independent gain control is a bit limiting. i.e. the choice is quiet and clean, or load and overdriven.
* on a breadboard, there's a bit of interference and noise in the mix. That would probably clean up quite a bit in a PCB build.
