# SuperheterodyneReceiverKit

Build and analyse a basic commercial radio recevier kit

## Notes

Just my notes on a build of [a kit from a seller on aliexpress](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/DIY-Kits-Superheterodyne-Radio-Receiver-6-Transistor-sch-case-w-Speaker/32367150788.html).

A superheterodyne receiver (often shortened to superhet) uses frequency mixing to convert a received signal to a fixed intermediate frequency (IF) which can be more conveniently processed than the original radio carrier frequency.
