# CrystalTester

Testing crystal oscillators with a frequency counter.

## Notes

[G3PTO's Xtal Tester](http://www.qsl.net/g3pto/xtest.html) is a simple circuit for
measuring an (unknown) crystal's fundamental resonant frequency with a frequency counter.
It's a very basic test, but good enough to verify the crystal is working and finding it's frequency.

Of course, the reverse is also true: the circuit provides a nice reference signal for testing a frequency counter!
