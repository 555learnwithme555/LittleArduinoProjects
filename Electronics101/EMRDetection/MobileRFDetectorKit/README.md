# MobileRFDetectorKit (WIP)

Build and investigate a commercially available "mobile phone signal" detector kit

## Notes

I picked up a ["Mobile Phone Signal Flash Light Radiation Power DIY Kit"](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Mobile-Phone-Signal-Flash-Light-Radiation-Power-DIY-New-Kit-Components/32298290064.html) for USD1.15. Firstly to experiment with the kit/circuit, and secondly as its a pretty cheap way to get hold of a 1SS86 barrier diode.

### First Test - breadboard build

The circuit is supposed to be tuned for detecting mobile phone [GSM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM) signals - not CDMA or other -
but that itself is a [pretty big bag of frequencies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM_frequency_bands).

Putting the circuit on a breadboard will I expect affect it's behaviour, as I guess the breadboard rails act either as shield or antenna.

The breadboard build yields curious results:
* with antenna attached, the circuit is permanently "on"
* with no antenna, it detects a bunch of things:
  - flourescent light radiation
  - proximity to wires
  - hands and body parts!
* what it can't detect is a mobile phone signal;-)
  - perhaps because I think the phone is on [HSPA+ over WCDMA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolved_HSPA)
